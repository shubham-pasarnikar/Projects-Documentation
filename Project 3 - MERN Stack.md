# Project 3 - MERN Stack
### MERN Stack is a web develeopment framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components.

Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

* MongoDB: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.

* NodeJS: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

* ExpressJS: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.

* ReactJS: A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.
