# Project 3 - MERN Stack
### MERN Stack is a web develeopment framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components.

Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

* MongoDB: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.

* NodeJS: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

* ExpressJS: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.

* ReactJS: A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.

### Understanding the Parts of the MERN Stack

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-based database known as a nonrelational document-orientated database, or NoSQL. MongoDB stores data in flexible documents using a query language based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The size, number and content of document fields vary, so the data structure can be altered later on. MongoDB is easy to scale and quite flexible, making it popular among many web developers.

## ExpressJS

Express is a back end framework for Node.js web applications. We can use Express to make writing server code much simpler, as opposed to the traditional alternative of manually writing full web server code on Node.js, since it lets us avoid having to repeat the same code like we would using the Node.js HTTP module. Express’s framework was designed to enable simple, easy construction of APIs and efficient web applications. It is loaded with plugin features and is renowned for its speed. Its minimalistic structure makes it simple for developers to pick up and start using right away.

## ReactJS

In React, views are declarative, meaning developers do not have to manage the effects of changes in data or the view’s state. (A view’s state is the object that determines the behavior of individual components.) Instead, React lets developers use a full-featured programming language to design conditional or repetitive DOM elements rather than relying on templates that automatically create repetitive DOM (Document Object Model) or HTML elements. React lets the same code run on the browser and server simultaneously, which is what enables React to anchor the MERN stack and makes it essential to the operation.

## NodeJS

Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and is intended to allow developers to build scalable network applications and execute JavaScript code outside of browsers. Node.js works by using its own module system that is based on CommonJS, meaning it does not need an enclosing HTML page to put together more than one JavaScript file.
